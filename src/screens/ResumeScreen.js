          Here are all my notable achievments. Clicking on each card will give you a more detailed description of each
          of my endeavours. As you can see, one of my main strength is the diversity of my skillset. While studying my
          undergraduate degree in Accounting and Finance, I have constantly been concurrently teaching myself Software
          and Web Development.
