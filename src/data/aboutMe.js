    'Intro': `I am a Third Year Undergraduate at the London School of Economics and
          Political Science. I am passionate about many things and I take pride in
          the actions I perform. That, in essence, is why I decided to redesign
          my website`,
    
    'A Brief History': [
        `I moved to South Africa when I was four years old where I underwent all of 
        my primary and secondary education.`,

        `I went to boarding school from the ages of 14-18 which thoroughly moulded who
        I am today. I attribute much of my quick thinking and EQ to this experience.`,

        `I embarked on a short stint at Sellenbosh University before I moved to 
        London to pursue an undergraduate degree in Accounting and Finance.`,

        `I've always loved using technology and was probably the first bloke I know
        who knew how to dowload torrent or jailbreak a phone`,

        `I've caught the bug for intellectual aquisition and I'm extremely grateful for
        catching it. I'm self-taught in VBA, Python, and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.`,

        `I'm an absolue fiend for formatting my documents, uni notes, etc. I'm constatly looking
        for ways to better my workflow. Currently I've settled on writing notes in rmarkdown
        in VIM and then using bookdown, pandoc, and RStudio to create a beautiful PDF and
        HTML book. This is arguably the best decision I've ever made.`,

        `I'm also a sucker for regular old analytical work because, I'm just a bit of a loser.
        I get extreme satisfaction from analysing a set of financial statements or doing
        a discount cash flow analysis.`,
        
        `Naturally, I owe just about everything to my parents who have worked their utmost to
        allow me every opportunity I've come accross.`,
    ]
