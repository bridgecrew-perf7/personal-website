  about: `I sat down one day dissatisfied with my old personal site, I'd just
          learnt React.js and decided to redesign my site from the ground up. It
          helped me solidify my React knowledge but, most importantly, it
          introduced me to TailwindCSS. This website is a showcase of my initial
          capabilities using React and Tailwind. To an extent, building this
          website also honed my eye for design. I had gradiose plans of creating
          my own backend using Django like I've done in the past for eCommerce
          sites I have test built and host my backend on a Raspberry Pi, then
          reality dawned on me and I realised I didn't have A Raspberry Pi and
          no real reason for hosting a backend other than updating it with CV
          information.`,
