## Where to store static info

From reading some other's code, I've noticed that, when you're not using a
Backend, and trying to keep your website static so you can host it on git-
hub, it's a good idea to put the stuff you would have to hard code into a 
data folder and into subsequent files. This is all stuff like CV details etc.
